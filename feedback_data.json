One common method is to use df.head(), which shows the first five rows. But that's just a preview; it doesn't show all the data.\n\nI remember that when you print the DataFrame directly, it displays more information by default, but sometimes this isn't enough or might be cut off depending on the size of the dataset. So I need something more comprehensive.\n\nWait, maybe using to_string() could help? That function converts the DataFrame into a string, which might show all rows and columns without getting truncated. Let me check how that works.\n\nAnother thought: if the DataFrame is too large, even converting it to a string might not display everything nicely. Maybe resetting the index or sorting could help in making sure all data is visible when printed.\n\nI should also consider using pd.set_option('display.max_rows', None) to ensure pandas shows as many rows as there are. But I have to be careful with this because it can make the output very long and hard to read if not managed properly.\n\nPutting it all together, the best approach might be to first set the display options to show all rows and then convert the DataFrame to a string using to_string(). That way, I get all the data in a readable format.\n</think>\n\nTo display the entire dataset, you can use pandas' DataFrame.to_string() method or reset the index.\n\n\n# Option 1: Display all rows and columns\npd.set_option('display.max_rows', None)\npd.set_option('display.max_columns', None)\nprint(df.to_string())\n\n# Option 2: Show all data with a cleaner format\ndf.reset_index(drop=True, inplace=True)\nprint(df)",
